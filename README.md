Data Types and Structure
In this project, we will collect and share multi-source urban data to develop dynamic and multidimensional measures in urban segregation. The datasets should contain information including: 
	Socioeconomic Status Datasets (e.g. Census data, Financial Register Data, Bank Transfer Data) with information like racial, ethnic, gender, education, income, employee skill, etc.
	Spatiotemporal Behavior Datasets (For example, raw taxi data should be preprocessed and organized the format as follow: taxi_id, pick_up_time, drop_off_time, pick_up_intersection, drop_off_intersection)
	Urban Socioeconomic Datasets (e.g. Housing Price Data)
	Other Data could be used to analysis above information

Submit Data
Metadata and Analysis Results will be submitted, shared, stored, and made publicly available on the QMVUS GitHub Repository.

File Format
Metadata and Analysis Results should be organized in simple ASCII comma- delimited files (*.csv files) with clear header names.

File Naming
For simplicity, please collect your files in a single folder with a short description (e.g. SingaporeTaxi). Analysis Results should be named with the main content of data and also the dimension of measurement (e.g. SingaporeTaxi_Evenness.csv or Friendship_Exposure.csv)

File Organization
Measurement data from repeated experiments should be saved and submitted as separate files, numbered sequentially (e.g., SingaporeTaxi_Evenness1.csv or Friendship_Exposure2.csv).

File Description
Please also include a separate README file (.txt or .docx) that provides a description of the data processing and the detail of the metrics.

Note, some iteration on formatting may be required before the results can be merged into the QMVUS database.
